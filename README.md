This component creates a sign-up form that matches the layout and style of the image. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Key features include:

- Centered layout with flex
- Responsive width for input and buttons
- Styled buttons for email, Google, and Apple sign-in options
- Hover effects on buttons
- Link for existing users to sign in

To use this component, make sure you have Tailwind CSS set up in your React project. You may need to adjust some classes or values to perfectly match your design requirements or to fit within your existing design system.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code or suggest any modifications?
